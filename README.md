### üîç Data Quality Issues

While the dataset is quite rich, I observed several data quality issues during initial exploration:

#### **Users dataset**
- `STATE`, `GENDER`, `BIRTH_DATE`, and especially `LANGUAGE` have missing values ‚Äî with `LANGUAGE` missing in over 30% of records. This limits user segmentation or demographic-level analysis.

#### **Transactions dataset**
- `FINAL_QUANTITY` included both numeric values and the string `'zero'`, suggesting inconsistent data entry or ingestion. I cleaned this column by converting all values to numeric and replaced `0` with `1` based on the business assumption that if a user scanned a receipt, they most likely purchased at least one unit.
- `FINAL_SALE` is missing in 25% of rows, and both `FINAL_SALE` and `FINAL_QUANTITY` are highly skewed ‚Äî which may require transformation or outlier handling in downstream analysis.
- `BARCODE` is missing in about 11.5% of transactions, which could affect joins with the Products table.

#### **Products dataset**
- `CATEGORY_4` is missing in 92% of records, limiting its usefulness for product segmentation.
- `MANUFACTURER` and `BRAND` each have about 27% missing data and include placeholder entries like `"PLACEHOLDER MANUFACTURER"` and `"BRAND NEEDS REVIEW"` that appear to be temporary or unfinalized.

### üß† Fields That Are Challenging to Understand

A few fields stood out as particularly ambiguous during the cleaning and exploration process:

#### `FINAL_QUANTITY` (Transactions)
Initially confusing due to the presence of the string `'zero'` and numeric zeros. It was unclear whether 0 meant ‚Äúnot purchased‚Äù or was a placeholder. Based on the receipt-scanning business context, I assumed these values reflected actual purchases and standardized them to `1`.

#### `CATEGORY_1‚Äì4` (Products)
The product category fields seem to follow a hierarchical structure, but their depth and usage vary significantly across rows. Some records only populate `CATEGORY_1` and `CATEGORY_2`, while others go down to `CATEGORY_4`. Without a defined taxonomy or documentation, it‚Äôs difficult to assess the consistency or analytical value of these fields.

#### `BRAND` and `MANUFACTURER`
Some entries contain placeholders or unclear names, raising questions about data completeness and whether these fields are finalized or ready for analysis.

## Part III: Slack Message with Stakeholders

### üì¢ Summary of Findings

Hi team! I wanted to share a quick update from my initial analysis of the datasets:

#### üîç Key Data Quality Issues
- **Missing Demographics:** Nearly **99.5%** of Health & Wellness sales couldn‚Äôt be linked to user demographics. Only **17 out of ~3,000 customers** had matching records in Users Dataset, limiting our ability to analyze generational trends or segment customers effectively.
- **User Data Missing Values:** Fields like `LANGUAGE` (missing ~30%) and `BIRTH_DATE` (missing ~4%) show significant gaps.
- **Inconsistent Quantity Values:** The `FINAL_QUANTITY` field in the Transactions dataset contained mixed types (e.g., the string `'zero'`).  
  Based on the receipt-scanning context, I standardized all zeros to **1**, assuming these reflect actual purchases.  
  _(Happy to revisit this assumption if needed.)_

#### üìà Interesting Trend
- **TOSTITOS** emerged as the top brand in the **Dips & Salsa** category, leading in both quantity sold and customer reach.  
  This points to strong brand preference and could inform targeted promotions or brand partnerships through Fetch.

#### ‚úÖ Next Steps
- I recommend reviewing our **data collection practices** and taking a closer look at the **user-transaction-product mapping processes** to address the large gaps in demographic coverage. Improving data completeness will significantly enhance our ability to surface meaningful, actionable insights.
